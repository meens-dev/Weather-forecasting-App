# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting App

This is a personal Python project built to understand how APIs work and how to fetch real-time data from external sources. The app takes a city name as input and returns current weather information using the WeatherAPI.

## 📌 About the Project

- Built using Python and the `requests` library
- Fetches real-time weather data such as:
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Humidity (%)
  - Wind Speed (km/h)
  - Weather condition
- Displays data in a clean, user-friendly format
- Handles errors like invalid city names

This project helped me improve my API integration skills and understand how to work with JSON data.
